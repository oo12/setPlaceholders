A MODX Revolution snippet for getting fields and setting placeholders.

setPlaceholders combines the usefulness of placeholders—which are
rather like local variables—with a fast and versatile engine for
gathering up various data: fields and TVs from a resource or any of
its ancestors, children or siblings, plus several other useful things.

It provides the functionality of getResourceField, UltimateParent, and
getUrlParam—in addition to quite a bit more—all in one lightweight
package.
